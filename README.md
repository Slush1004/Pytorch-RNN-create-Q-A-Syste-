# PyTorch RNN Q&A System: Simple QA with Custom Dataset

Releases: https://github.com/Slush1004/Pytorch-RNN-create-Q-A-Syste-/releases

[![Releases](https://img.shields.io/badge/Releases-online-green?logo=github)](https://github.com/Slush1004/Pytorch-RNN-create-Q-A-Syste-/releases)

ðŸš€ This repository hosts a compact PyTorch project that builds a simple RNN to predict answers from input questions using a custom QA dataset. It tokenizes text, builds a vocabulary, converts words to indices, and feeds the data through an embedding layer, an RNN, and a final linear layer. Training uses CrossEntropyLoss, and a predict function generates answers with softmax probabilities. The goal is to provide a clear, runnable example that demonstrates the end-to-end flow from raw questions to predicted answers.

## Overview

This project showcases a straightforward approach to a question-answer (QA) task using a recurrent neural network (RNN). The model reads a textual question, processes it through an embedding layer, passes the sequence through an RNN, and maps the final hidden state to a probability distribution over possible answers with a linear layer and softmax. The dataset is custom-made for the exercise, with questions paired to predefined answers. The training objective is the cross-entropy loss, a standard choice for multi-class QA problems.

The design favors clarity and accessibility. You can study how a vocabulary is built, how words get mapped to indices, and how a simple neural architecture can learn to associate questions with correct answers. The predict function demonstrates practical inference by producing probabilities over answers and selecting the most likely option.

This repository is a solid starting point for beginners who want to see how text data flows through a PyTorch modelâ€”from raw text to numerical tensors to a trained predictor. It also serves as a compact blueprint for extending to more complex QA systems later.

ðŸ§  Key ideas:
- Text is tokenized into words.
- A vocabulary maps words to integer indices.
- Each word becomes an embedding vector.
- An RNN processes the sequence of embeddings.
- A linear layer converts the final representation to a score for each possible answer.
- Softmax turns scores into probabilities.
- CrossEntropyLoss trains the model by comparing predicted probabilities with true labels.

---

## Key ideas

- Tokenization: split text into word tokens, normalize case, and handle punctuation in a consistent way.
- Vocabulary: assign a unique index to every token seen in the dataset.
- Embedding: learn dense vector representations for tokens.
- RNN: capture order-dependent patterns in questions.
- Classification head: map the RNN output to a set of candidate answers.
- Training objective: cross-entropy loss over the answer classes.
- Inference: produce a distribution over answers and pick the top candidate.

---

## Tech stack

- Basic shell for training and testing

The code is intentionally compact. It focuses on readability and a clear demonstration of core concepts rather than production-scale optimization.

## Dataset and tokenization

- Dataset: a custom QA collection. Each example pairs a question with a correct answer from a finite vocabulary of possible answers.
- Tokenization: simple whitespace-based split with lowercasing.
- Vocabulary: built from the training data. Unknown tokens are mapped to a special UNK index.
- Word-to-index mapping: a small dictionary that grows with the dataset.
- Input representation: a sequence of indices, fixed to a maximum length via padding or truncation.
- Output representation: an integer class label representing the correct answer.

Practical tips:
- Keep the dataset compact during experimentation.
- Ensure questions and answers are aligned; the same question should map to the same answer class across the dataset.
- Use a validation split to monitor overfitting.

---

## Model architecture

- Embedding layer: converts token indices to dense vectors.
- Recurrent layer: a simple RNN (vanilla RNN or a lightweight GRU/LSTM, depending on the variant you choose) processes the sequence of embeddings.
- Classification head: a linear layer maps the RNN output to a vector whose length equals the number of possible answers.
- Activation: softmax on the output scores to obtain probabilities.

Why this structure:
- A compact embedding captures word semantics.
- The RNN models the order of words in a question.
- A single linear head yields a probability distribution over answers.
- Softmax provides interpretable probabilities for decision making.

Hyperparameters to consider:
- embedding_dim: 128â€“256 is a good starting point.
- hidden_dim: 256â€“512 provides a balance between capacity and speed.
- num_layers: 1â€“2 layers keep the model small and trainable on small datasets.
- dropout: 0.1â€“0.3 helps reduce overfitting.
- max_seq_len: 20â€“40 is often enough for short questions; adjust as needed.

Implementation notes:
- Use batch processing to improve training efficiency.
- Pad sequences in a consistent manner and use attention to ignore padding if your framework allows.
- Keep the vocabulary size modest to avoid overfitting and to speed up training.

## Training details

- Loss function: CrossEntropyLoss, suitable for multi-class classification.
- Optimizer: Adam or AdamW for stable convergence with minimal tuning.
- Learning rate: start around 0.001 and adjust based on validation performance.
- Batch size: 16â€“64 depending on memory and dataset size.
- Epochs: train long enough to see convergence, but monitor validation accuracy to avoid overfitting.
- Evaluation: track accuracy on a held-out validation set; optionally track per-class metrics.

Practical tips:
- Normalize input sequences in the same way during training and inference.
- Save the best model based on validation accuracy to avoid overfitting.
- Use a simple learning rate scheduler to adjust the rate as training progresses.

---

## Prediction and inference

- Inference uses the trained embedding, RNN, and linear head to produce a score vector for all possible answers.
- Softmax converts scores to probabilities.
- The top-probability class is returned as the predicted answer.
- You can also return the full probability distribution for analysis or confidence estimation.

A typical usage flow:
- Load the saved model state.
- Tokenize a new question with the same tokenizer and vocabulary.
- Convert tokens to indices, pad to max_seq_len as done during training.
- Run a forward pass to obtain the probability distribution.
- Select the answer with the highest probability.

Tip: to improve usefulness, you can extend this by adding a confidence threshold. If the top probability is low, you can prompt for clarification or return a fallback answer.

- Demo asset: qa_rnn_demo.py (download from the releases)

---

## Data format and preparation

- Input data: a text file or CSV with questions and corresponding answers.
- Each row should contain a question string and a label for the correct answer.
- Tokenization: convert questions into lists of tokens. Convert tokens to lowercase. Remove or normalize punctuation as needed.
- Vocabulary: build a mapping from tokens to integer IDs. Include special tokens such as PAD and UNK.
- Sequences: pad or truncate to a fixed length (max_seq_len) so every input has the same shape.
- Labels: map each answer to a unique integer ID. The total number of classes equals the number of distinct answers in your dataset.

Best practices:
- Start with a small dataset to validate the pipeline.
- Ensure consistent preprocessing across training and inference.
- Save the vocabulary alongside the model so inference uses the same mapping.

## Performance considerations

- Small datasets train quickly. You can see meaningful results within a few epochs.
- Larger vocabularies increase memory and training time. Keep the vocabulary size reasonable for a quick start.
- Embedding dimension influences memory more than you might expect. If you hit memory limits, reduce embedding_dim or batch size.
- The RNNâ€™s depth (num_layers) affects both capacity and training speed. Start with 1 layer and move to 2 if needed.

---

## Best practices

- Keep preprocessing deterministic. Any mismatch between training and inference causes degraded performance.
- Save both the model and the vocabulary. The same mapping must be used during inference.
- Use a simple baseline to gauge progress. Start with a unigram baseline or a logistic regression on bag-of-words features for comparison.
- Monitor overfitting. If accuracy on the training set grows while validation stagnates, reduce model complexity or add regularization.
- Document all experiments. Save the exact hyperparameters and dataset splits used for each run.

---

## Troubleshooting

- If you see dimension mismatch errors, re-check max_seq_len and the padding strategy. Ensure the input tensor shapes align across embedding, RNN, and linear layers.
- If training loss plateaus, try a smaller learning rate or a different optimizer. Increase gradient clipping if you observe exploding gradients.
- If predictions are random, verify that the vocabulary contains the test tokens and that indices map correctly to embeddings.
- If you cannot download assets, visit the Releases page and download the needed files manually, then run the provided scripts locally.

---

## Extending the project

- Add attention: introduce a simple attention mechanism to weigh token representations before the final classification.
- Use bidirectional RNN: capture context from both directions, potentially improving performance on longer questions.
- Expand output space: allow more answer classes by enlarging the dataset and retraining.
- Experiment with different tokenization schemes: character-level or subword tokens can help with rare words and creativity in questions.
- Implement batching and multiprocessing data loaders for large datasets.
- Export and serve the model: build a small API using FastAPI or Flask to expose a predict endpoint.
